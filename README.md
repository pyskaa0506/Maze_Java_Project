## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a Java program with a graphical user interface using the Swing technology. The program allows for loading mazes from text and binary files, finding the shortest path from the entrance to the exit, and saving the maze with or without a solution.

## Program Features

- **Toolbar Panel**: The interface includes a toolbar panel that enables maze manipulation, including changing the entrance and exit points.
- **Maze and Path Display**: Graphical display of the loaded maze and the identified path.
- **Saving to PNG**: The ability to save the maze (with or without a solution) as an image in PNG format.

## Binary File Handling

The program allows for loading and saving mazes in binary format, requiring correct data processing according to the specified format.

## Compilation and Execution

To run the application, navigate to the `out/artifacts/Maze_JAVA_jar` directory and double-click the `Maze_JAVA.jar` file.
